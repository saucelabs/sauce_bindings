Welcome To The New Evolution In Sauce Labs Testing.
The goal of Sauce Bindings is to make your test automation and integration in Sauce Labs, simple :)
Our fluent API helps you to understand all of the possible browser/OS combinations at design time.
You no longer need to read extensive docs, just let your IDE guide you ðŸ˜‰

## Quick Start with a single line of code
```
WebDriver driver = new SauceSession().start();
//now use the driver to interact with your test in Sauce Labs
driver.findElement("id").click();
```

## Installation

[Installation instructions](https://opensource.saucelabs.com/sauce_bindings/getting-started)

## Building

Make sure you have the common Sauce Bindings [prerequisites](https://github.com/saucelabs/sauce_bindings#getting-started-and-prerequisites) set up, as well as

-  Java 11+ JDK,
-  Maven,
-  Your favorite Java IDE ([IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/index.html) preferred but not required).

The Java Sauce Bindings are designed as a standard Maven project and follow Maven conventions.

## Local development

First clone this project, either directly or from a fork. The following instructions will be based on a local clone of the Sauce Bindings repository.

To create a `.jar` of the Java bindings in their current state in your local repository, run

```bash
mvn package
```

in the `java/` (root) directory. This will create a `.jar` file in the `java/target/` directory which you can them use as you like.

If you'd like to make Sauce Bindings available to other local projects via Maven, run

```bash
mvn install
```

in the `java/` directory. This will allow you to import Sauce Bindings as a Maven dependency in other local projects on your laptop as a snapshot of the state based on the commit that you build from. To add this reference via Maven, add

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.saucelabs</groupId>
    <artifactId>sauce_bindings</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

to other projects' `pom.xml` file to access Sauce Bindings. Note that adding these coordinates to other Maven projects will get the latest `1.0-SNAPSHOT` version that was built, and so using these coordinates are recommended for development and not for general usage.

## Testing

To execute the test suite, run

```bash
mvn test
```

Tests will also be automatically executed as part of the building process.

## Deploying

#### Prerequisites
1.	Ensure you have access to Sauce Repository on Sonatype: https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/OSSRH-34416
2.	Install gpg2

#### Release
1. Execute in terminal: `mvn release:prepare`
    * This does:
        * Runs the tests to ensure passing
        * Removes the `SNAPSHOT` from the version in the `pom.xml`
        * Commit changes and tags the release
        * Bumps version to next development version with `SNAPSHOT`
        * Commit changes

2. Answer Questions:
    * "What is the release version for "saucebindings"? (com.saucelabs:sauce_bindings) 1.0.1"
        * Major Releases indicate backward incompatible changes
        * Minor Releases indicate new features available in all languages
        * Point Releases are for updates to language specific functionality
    * "What is SCM release tag or label for "saucebindings"? (com.saucelabs:sauce_bindings) sauce_bindings-1.0.1"
        * use format: "java-1.0.1"
    * "What is the new development version for "saucebindings"? (com.saucelabs:sauce_bindings) 1.0.2-SNAPSHOT"
        * hit enter

3. Execute in terminal: `GPG_TTY=$(tty) mvn release:perform`
    * This does:
        * Runs the tests to ensure passing
        * Builds Jar
        * Uploads artifacts to maven profile

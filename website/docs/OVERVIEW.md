### Making test automation with Sauce Labs intuitively simple

Writing and maintaining automated test frameworks is hard work. 
Sauce Labs wants to reduce the complexity of integrating with our service. 
We've created Sauce Bindings, an interface to simplify working with Sauce Labs session-related interactions. 

Sauce Bindings has three main goals:

-   Provide test developers with a wrapper or _binding_ for the most popular programming languages
 used for web and mobile testing (Mobile support coming soon, see our [roadmap](ROADMAP.md)).
-   Provide a concise API for connecting to Sauce Labs in test frameworks and making use of Sauce Labs features.
-   Provide an excellent developer user experience for using Sauce Labs in a straightforward way.

## Supported Language Bindings

We support the most popular automation programming languages:

-   Java
-   Python
-   Ruby
-   C#

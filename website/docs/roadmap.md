There are a number of features we will be looking to add.
If there is something you'd like to see that isn't on this list, please
[open a ticket](https://github.com/saucelabs/sauce_bindings/issues/new).

This is the current plan for major features in future versions. Point releases may be created
to address language-specific bugs.

## 2.0

- UPDATE ME

## Additional Plans

- Methods for Session related information and updates (no need to use a REST Client with our API)
- Methods for managing assets (screenshots, video, etc)
- Methods to work with Extended Debugging Functionality (convert from language data structures instead of requiring JSON)
- Access to improved Failure Analysis
- Additional [Test Runners](core-concepts/test-runners.md), and test runner specific functionality
